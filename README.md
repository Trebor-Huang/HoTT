Homotopy Type Theory in Python!!! This is a toy implementation of Homotopy Type Theory (with a TeX style programming language) in Python. I plan to include the following features:
- Type checking (of course)
- Unification and type inference
- Code is directly readable by LaTeX typesetter (with a handful of predefined macros)
